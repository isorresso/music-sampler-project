<h2>ABOUT THE ARTIST</h2>

<p>Ella Marija Lani Yelich-O'Connor, more commonly known by her stage name as "Lorde," is a New Zealander that has taken America by storm. At only 22 years old, she has already achieved so much in her music career. She's been nominated for 83 awards, won 42 of them and captured the hearts of many.</p>

<p class="text" >Her songs are written like poems and have more depth than other tracks being produced by pop and indie artists on the charts right now. Lorde's voice is hauntingly beautiful in songs such as "Biting Down" and "Yellow Flicker Beat." The latter was the lead single on "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1 Original Motion Picture Soundtrack" -- an album that Lorde was asked to curate for the film in 2014 when she was only 18 years old.</p>

<p class="text">The sound Lorde has created for herself is a mix between dark melodies and upbeat, catchy choruses, making her music stand out. Besides the sound, her songs are often clever commentaries on the people in her life and her surroundings. Her most recent album, "Melodrama," captures her life as a 19-year-old living in New York city, dealing with breakups, heartache and being a melodramatic teen.</p>
